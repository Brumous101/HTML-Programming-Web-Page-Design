Before we begin to learn the great sport of ping pong we should really start with a quote.

"You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take."

This quote may not have anything in particular to do with ping pong per se but it is all encompassing in life.
<br>
This can relate to all aspects of life. 
<br>
Too often than not a nonsports fan, like myself, is not interested in any sports.

Ping Pong is a game of sportsmanship, pride, and class.
<br>
However, most people are only familiar with the game from a buzzed standpoint.
<br>
This has become a point of contention within the ping pong community as the game is more associated with beer than exercise.
