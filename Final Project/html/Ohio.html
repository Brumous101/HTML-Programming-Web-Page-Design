<p class"Ohio">While the drive to Philidelphia is kind of far from Ohio we will have 2 spare seats in the buick that are free to ride in for those of you that want to go but don't want to drive.
 <i><span class="Masen">Masen</span></i>, <i><span class="Kyle">Kyle</span></i>, and <i><span class="Cameron">Cameron</span></i> will be those accompanying you on the way to Hei's.
</br>
</br>
The plan is to meet at Kyle's house as he has enough space to leave everyone's cars and then carpool with Cameron's car but with Masen as the driver as Cameron is a horrible driver (As seen by the different color hood from hitting a deer).
</p>
Below is pictures of the car that will accompany us on the journey to Hei!
