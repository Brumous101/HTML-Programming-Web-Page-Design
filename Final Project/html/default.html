<p class="Gamers">If you have found yourself on this site you are invited on the <i><b>highly anticipated,</i></b> months in the making, trip to Philidelphia to meet
<span class="Hei"> Hei </span> in person.</p>
While the trip to go see him is far away, the server thinks now is the best time for everyone that wants to go to make it. 
</br>
</br>
We plan to leave December 14th. This day would be best as everyone will be out for finals and it will be the start of the weekend as well.
