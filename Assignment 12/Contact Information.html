<p class"Contact"> As Michael's is a small business it currently does not have much infrastructure in place and as he is the only barber he is always busy cutting hair so he does not have time to answer calls or emails while his store is open.
</br>
</br>
If you would like to get a hold of Michael the best way to contact him is in person during business hours. Alternatively, you could submit a contact form from this website and he will try to get back with you!
