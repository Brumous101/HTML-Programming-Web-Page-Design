<p class="Origin">Michael Welch is a humble barber who started his professional career of cutting hair by cutting hair at <span class="Vogler"> Vogler's barbershop </span> in West Union Ohio. Previous to working as a barber he worked at the UPS 
warehouse in <i>Maysville</i> doing the <b>preload position.</b></p>
</br>
After working with Vogler for years he became a renowned hair stylist and the go to barber located in West Union. Michael does not brag or shy away from talking about his journey and the hurdles that come along with it.
