<p class="Chess">My chess carreer isn't as funny or as exciting as the ping pong section of my life. I love Chess but I have not played a serious game since high school. It does kind of suck being an adult and not being able to find many
of the same people with same hobbies as yourself. The simple fact of the matter is that not enough people have similar tastes in music, games, or just overarching hobbies as myself but I don't blame people cause I know that my hobbies are kind of abstract.
Chess club was another club my friends and I created at my high school when we were sophomores but I haven't played it since.</p>
