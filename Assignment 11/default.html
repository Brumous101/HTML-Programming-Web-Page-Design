<p class="Kyle">This is the website for Kyles by Kyles on all Kyle related hobbies. If you check to the left of this page you will find a menu for the variety of hobbies (or lack thereof). My information and how to get ahold of me can be found at the bottom
left of this page. I'm 19 years old, in my second year at Shawnee State University, and a student in the CET program. Currently, I'm taking a Calculus class that most of my peers are failing and while I don't know how to swim in real life I am also barely
staying above water. I hope to graduate in the next 2 years with my bachelore's in <b><i>Computer Engineering Technology</i></b> with a minor in <b><i>Math</i></b> and a second minor in <b><i>Cybersecurity</i></b> which I actually decided on doing today.</p>
Always drowning in homework and <span class="why"> always confused by those around me.</span> Sometimes Confused by myself all the same. I love music more than almost anything but at the time of writing this and setting up this site I went based off
pictures I had saved to my desktop so I would have an easier time putting my... pen to paper... Thoughts to type?... Whatever that phrase is analogous to is what I'm going for.
