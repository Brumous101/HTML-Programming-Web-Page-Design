<p class"Pong"> I haven't played Ping Pong since highschool but I find it easy to talk about because it's hilarious that I was actually able to convince my high school officials to sign off for the sport. When I created the club I made a psuedo official
looking petition at the library as a joke and got my friends to sign it and then took it to class and passed it around to get even more signatures and eventually had to print out more copies.
</br>
</br>
I took the petition to the school principal and he told me to talk to the athletic chair and ask for funding to get a quote. The chair and I agreed on a 500 dollar budget to buy 2 tables. Two weeks later we had two tables, and I knew of three teachers that
use to play Ping Pong that were interested in administrating the club and it turned out to be a huge success. Kids started to bring in their own ping pong tables because when we just had 2 only 4 people could play even though there was over 20 people
at each club meeting. 
</br>
</br>
Most of them weren't as passionate as my friends and I about the sport but to be honest I think they just played ping pong while they waited for their mom to pick them up from the school.
