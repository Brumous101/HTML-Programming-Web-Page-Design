<p class="runescape"> Runescape has always been a constant in my life. Between girlfriends, between friendships, and between classes. Runescape has always been there! I am a veteran of the game at this point. I've played for the past 13 years or so and
could tell you anything and everything about the game. I've created probably 5 different accounts and actively play on 2 of them currently. I started with a normal account that could use all the functions in the game and then in 2014 Jagex (the owner of the game)
made a game mode that makes it to where you can not trade with other players making you not in the economy and being your own.
</br>
</br>This was a good thing as previous to that the best way to get ahead in the game was to play 4 accounts or more at the same time.
I started the gamemode and eventually got bored and tried the extra hard game mode where you can only carry 28 items and can't use the storage facilities in game. In the picture below I was able to get one of the hardest skills to the max level without
using the banking functions in game with the official <i>Ultimate Ironman</i> Gamemode.
