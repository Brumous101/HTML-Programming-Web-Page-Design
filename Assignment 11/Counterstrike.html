<p class"CSGO"> I know it's early but you have already looked at the list of hobbies I have and grown curious. Seriously? Counter-Strike in 2018? The truth is I haven't really ever played the game until about a month ago and it sinks any freetime I have 
available now. It's a great and cheap way <span class="questionable"> to have fun with friends!</span> At the time of making this hobbies page I have probably paused the assignment two times to go back to playing CSGO. My friends are much better than me,
but I get better with each game and I will eventually pass them in kills per game.

Gambling addiction is a real thing. I'm not speaking from personal experience but some of my friends gamble a lot of money into the game to buy custom skins for their
weapons. I have never seen it as a good thing to do because they are cosmetic and gambling might be fun but chances are you aren't going to win that really cool knife and at least if we took the $2.50 spent on the gambling item in game to a restaurant we 
could buy a sandwich or cola or something. Also, it is probably just cheaper to buy the weapon skins that you want from other players without gambling, but that's not gonna convince them.
