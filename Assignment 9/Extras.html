	<p class="essential"> Halloween is the best holiday because the environment surrounding the holiday is counterculture.</p>
	It's the <b>only</b> day of the year where people are able to be someone they aren't the other 364.25 days a year. 
	<p class="essential change">The weather is changing, the leaves are changing, and it gives the idea that your personal identity can change too.</p>
	Go get some free candy, hit the gym, and <span class="essential love"> ask your crush out on a date!</span> If you don't have a date there is no shame in catching a scary movie by yourself (see showings above).</br>

	It's because of all of these reasons that Halloween &gt Christmas.
